# nvim-tablecalc

## Description
- My first experiments with Lua
- Goal: Implement basic table calculations within Vim

## Status
- Work in progress

## TODOs
- Write tests (test .md and .csv functioniliy too)
- Fix bug: Not every lua code is evaluated without erros (test print)
- Add functioniliy:
    - It accepts ranges (Table.column.2-5,8)
    - Analoge to sum, multiply
    - Calculate correclty with the results of formulas
    - Styleing: Formulas should look like comments, results maybe in a new line
    - Table creater (extra plugin)
    - Transform tables from well known formats (extra program, use Ruby, very optional)
- refactor
