# nvim-tablecalc

## Description
- My first experiments with Lua
- Goal: Implement basic table calculations within Vim

## Status
- Work in progress

## TODOs
- ~~FixBug: Formulas in same row bug: see asoc_table2.org~~
- Test reserved words as table/ column name (sum)
- Improve tests (test .md and .csv functioniliy too)
- ~~only eval math expressions~~
- Add functioniliy:
    - Analoge to sum, multiply
    - ~~Calculate correclty with the results of formulas~~
    - Styling: ~~Formulas should have a different color~~, results maybe in a new line
    - Tablename and maybe row numbers should be optional
    - ~~Set table_name_marker by filetype~~
    - ~~avoid recursiv self calls~~
    - ~~Table creator~~
- Robust error handling
- refactor
