# nvim-tablecalc

## Description
- My first experiments with Lua
- Goal: Implement basic table calculations within Vim

## Status
- Work in progress

## TODOs
- Improve tests (test .md and .csv functioniliy too)
- ~~only eval math expressions~~
- Add functioniliy:
    - It accepts ranges (Table.column.2-5,8)
    - Analoge to sum, multiply
    - ~~Calculate correclty with the results of formulas~~
    - Styling: Formulas should look like comments, results maybe in a new line
    - Tablename and maybe row numbers should be optional
    - Set delimeters by filetype
    - Table creator (extra plugin)
    - Transform tables from well known formats (extra program, use Ruby, very optional)
- Robust error handling
- refactor
